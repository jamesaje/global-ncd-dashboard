# Global NCD Mortality Insights Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard visualizes global trends in **non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality** using official data from the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. It aims to uncover patterns across regions, income groups, and gender — helping to raise awareness of a silent global epidemic.

## 🩺 What Are NCDs?

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are chronic illnesses that **cannot be transmitted from person to person**. They include:
- 🫀 Cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart attack, stroke)
- 🎗️ Cancers
- 🌬️ Chronic respiratory diseases
- 🍬 Diabetes

NCDs are responsible for over **43 million deaths annually** — 75% of all non-pandemic-related deaths — with the majority occurring in **low- and middle-income countries**.
